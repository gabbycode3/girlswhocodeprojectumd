## About

My name is Mira Baliga and I'm from Cupertino, California. I currently live in Maryland, where I attend the University of Maryland, College Park.

I'm a computer science major and Spanish minor. I wrote an <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-08-what-it-really-takes-to-get-girls-like-me-to-code" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> about how we can get more girls interested in programming, and I developed an iPhone app called Allot Expense Tracker that is <a href="http://appsto.re/us/GGuD_.i" target="_blank"><u>available</u></a> on the Apple App Store now!

I'm also a passionate social activist. I've lobbied Congress with the ACLU, and I'm currently planning Equals Equals, a hackathon for under-represented minorities in computer science.

In my spare time I enjoy drawing and painting. I also love dogs, and although I don't currently own one, I would love to adopt a corgi someday.
